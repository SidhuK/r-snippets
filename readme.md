Most of these have been tested and work as expected, however there could be some bugs and syntax errors, so please let me know if you find any.

Some of these snippets might require tweaking for your specific use case, and a lot of them are just a starting point, so further customization is required.

Tidyverse is used in most of the snippets, so you will need to have the tidyverse package installed and loaded.

You are welcome to contribute to this project. Please fork the repo and submit a pull request. I will review and merge as appropriate.
